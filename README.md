### Overview of the Weather Application Project

#### 1. **Project Description**
This weather application is a simple web-based project that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city they enter. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it to the user in a clean, user-friendly interface.

#### 2. **Key Features**
- **City Search:** Users can input the name of any city to retrieve its current weather data.
- **Real-Time Data:** The application fetches up-to-date weather information, including temperature, weather condition, and an appropriate weather icon.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is designed to be simple and responsive, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### 3. **Technologies Used**
- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the web application.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the application, including layout, colors, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the logic for fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and updating the user interface dynamically.

#### 4. **How It Works**
- The user enters the name of a city into an input field and clicks the "Get Weather" button.
- JavaScript captures the user input and sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, including the city name and an API key.
- The API returns a JSON object containing weather data for the requested city.
- The application processes the JSON data and displays relevant information such as temperature, weather condition, and an icon representing the weather.

#### 5. **Project Structure**
- **index.html:** The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file responsible for styling the application.
